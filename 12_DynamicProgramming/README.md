# Dynamic programming

## Summary
- Use recursive function as least as possible (see `getHighestNumberInArray.js`)
  - Can cause O(N^2) instead of O(N) - or more
  - Avoid redundant recursive calls
- Avoid overlapping subproblem (e.g. fibonacci) using memoization or bottom-up
  - Memoization describes remembering previously computed functions
  - Basically dictionary caching
  - Going bottom up is basically other way around
    - Basically screw recursion and do it with a for loop
