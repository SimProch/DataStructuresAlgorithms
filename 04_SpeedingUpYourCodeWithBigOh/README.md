# Speeding up your code with Big Oh

## How
- Using suitable DS and Algorithms
- Changing conditions

## Example
- Take an unsorted array. We have to search every element in the array
- We can update this array to a sorted array by first sorting it.
- We can achieve better speeds by updating conditions (unsorted -> sorted)
- We can then use a better algorithm
