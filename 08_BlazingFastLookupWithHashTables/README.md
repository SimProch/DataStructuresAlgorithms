# Blazing fast Lookup with Hash Tables

## Names for hash tables
- Hashes
- Maps
- Hash maps
- Dictionaries
- Associative arrays
- Key-value pairs

## Summary
- Overview of hash tables
  - Key-value pairs
  - Accessing is O(1)
  - Overview of how computer works with it
  - Hash table is more efficient the less collisions there are
  - Computer does the hashing for us


## Algorithms
- Array is a subset of another
  - Iterate over one, add items to dictionary, iterate over other and see if dictionary contains all
